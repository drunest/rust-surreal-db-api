## Important

If you are testing the api with something like Postman, RapidApiClient, Dont forget to set the cookie secure to false and SameSite to lax in the `session.rs` so that it sets the cookie correcty file or I will add a env variable for it.
If you are testing it in a client side app on another origin then you should leave the `SameSite: None` and the session cookie secure to false. Otherwise the browser will not allow to set the cookie.
